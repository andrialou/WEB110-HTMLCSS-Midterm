            <h3>Bio</h3>
                <p>Alex is the scheduling officer for the KU School of Music and coordinates services for undergraduate music education and music therapy students. Since joining the KU community in 2017, she has taken on various scholarly, musical, and administrative support roles. While maintaining her role as a clarinetist with the KU Symphonic Band, Wind Ensemble, and Bravura Orchestra, she earned a dual master's degree in Musicology and Music Theory. Though Alex's scholarly expertise began with a passion for early twentieth-century composers and post-tonal theory, her work broadened into contemporary pop music theory, vocal polyphony, and the convergence of emo and Christian rock genres in the 1990s and 2000s, all of which is culminated in her master's thesis <i><a href="https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/29588" target="_blank">"Are You Listening?": Vocal Polyphony in the Christian Rock Music of Emery</a></i>. While completing her graduate studies and research, Alex worked as a circulation assistant at the Thomas Gorton Music & Dance Library in Murphy Hall. After graduating in 2019, she continued to work for KU in Enrollment Management as a student services representative, where she provided support to students, faculty, and staff on behalf of the Registrar, Admissions, and Financial Aid. Alex is excited to be back in Murphy Hall as part of a team of excellent staff providing support to the outstanding students and faculty in the School of Music.</p>
